This is the branch we should all work on. The Master is a backup copy I have.

Created Initial Screens
Created Password method to pop up warning message if password and username is incorrect. 
Username and Passwords are listed in the source code as plain text.
Username: ticklemeelmo
Password: Passw0rd


Need to do:
Add server functionality (use chat application for basic reference)
Add timeout feature for warning prompt...something like 1 second or so
Change the visibility of the buttons to be invisible.
